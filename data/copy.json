In many cities, that accountability is partly served by the civilian complaint process, or how citizens can individually report on police behavior."},{"type":"text","value":"Police complaints by citizens, ranging from physical abuse to unprofessional conduct, rarely result in consequences for officers. Concrete data is rare among departments, but in 2017, the Philadelphia Police Department became one of the few to report on every officer complaint it received. The patterns found in Philadelphia clarify many of the anecdotal observations across departments throughout the country, especially when it comes to racial disparities (e.g., complaints of White officers by Black civilians)."},{"type":"text","value":"This is a real complaint about verbal abuse, one among 10,000+ complaints dating back to 2013."}],"sampleComplaint1":"While Philadelphia’s public complaint data hides the identities of those involved, the records include the race and gender of the officer and person filing the complaint.","sampleComplaint2":[{"type":"text","value":"While complaint investigations in some cities are conducted by civilian oversight boards, in Philadelphia, investigations are conducted by the police department’s own Internal Affairs division."},{"type":"text","value":"In the case of this complaint, the investigation, like all complaints in Philadelphia, is conducted behind closed doors and much of the decision-making process is hidden from public view."},{"type":"text","value":"For this complaint, the police’s investigation of the officer’s alleged verbal abuse is classified as <span class=annotated-text>no sustained findings</span>.

Note that this tabulation is based only on the complaints dating back to 2013 that have been provided to the public, so these officers could have any number of additional complaints from 2012 or earlier. Like many other cities, a small group of officers in Philadelphia account for a disproportionate number of complaints. Over a dozen officers, <a href=https://whyy.org/articles/police-misconduct-in-philadelphia-unsealed-records-name-the-citys-most-cited-cops/>recently identified</a>, have been involved in ten or more publicly-disclosed complaints."}],"tilechart4":[{"type":"text","value":"The investigations have been filtered to include only \"Physical Abuse\" investigations, often filed in response to police use of force.

It is an important first step in holding police departments accountable, yet complaint summaries are redacted, disciplinary decision processes remain vague, and anonymized IDs replace the names of officers with more than a dozen recorded complaints. The lack of meaningful civilian review makes the investigative and disciplinary processes even more opaque. In order to hold institutions accountable, data and processes must not only be public, but also transparent."}]}
