In many cities, this accountability is partly served by the people’s ability to make formal complaints about police behavior."},{"type":"text","value":"Police complaints by citizens, ranging from physical abuse to unprofessional conduct, rarely result in consequences for officers. Concrete data is rare among departments, but in 2017, the Philadelphia Police Department became one of the few to report on every officer complaint it received. The patterns found in Philadelphia clarify many of the anecdotal observations across departments throughout the country, especially when it comes to racial disparities (e.g., complaints of White officers by Black civilians)."},{"type":"text","value":"This is a real complaint about verbal abuse, one among 10,000+ complaints dating back to 2013."}],"sampleComplaint1":"Philadelphia’s public data hides the identities of those involved, but records include the <span class=yellow-and-gold>race and gender</span> of the officer and person filing the complaint.","sampleComplaint2":[{"type":"text","value":"While complaint investigations in some cities are conducted by civilian oversight boards, investigations in Philadelphia are conducted by the police department’s Internal Affairs division."},{"type":"text","value":"In the case of this complaint, the investigation, like all complaints in Philadelphia, is conducted behind closed doors and much of the decision-making process is hidden from public view."},{"type":"text","value":"This complaint’s investigation by police of the officer’s alleged verbal abuse yielded an outcome of <span class=annotated-text>no sustained findings</span>, legalese for not enough evidence to back up the citizen’s complaint."}],"sunburst1":[{"type":"text","value":"This outcome is common.  The police department concludes “not sustained” in an overwhelming majority of cases.

The officer’s commander can also pass the complaint to the Police Board of Inquiry for a disciplinary hearing, composed of  three members of the police department who make a recommendation.

Over a dozen officers, <a href=https://whyy.org/articles/police-misconduct-in-philadelphia-unsealed-records-name-the-citys-most-cited-cops/>recently identified</a>, have been involved in ten or more publicly-disclosed complaints."}],"tilechart4":[{"type":"text","value":"Here, the investigations have been filtered to include only those involving \"Physical Abuse\", which include complaints filed in response to an officer’s use of force.

It is an important first step in holding police departments accountable, yet complaint summaries are redacted, disciplinary decision processes remain vague, and anonymized IDs replace the names of officers with more than a dozen recorded complaints. The lack of meaningful civilian review makes the investigative and disciplinary processes even more opaque. In order to hold institutions accountable, data and processes must not only be public, but also transparent."}],"method":[{"type":"text","value":"<p><strong>Sources/Notes</strong></p>"},{"type":"text","value":"<p>All complaint and disciplinary data since 2015 came from the <a href=https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints>City of Philadelphia Open Data Portal</a>.
